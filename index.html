<b> My Tech Journey into Tech</b>
<b>From the Psychology Space To the Tech</b>
<p> Meet Davina Nana Ama  Nkrumah-Buansi, a <b>Tech enthusiastand woman empowerment activist.</b>
    She has managed to bridge the gap between being a woman and managing the tech space 
    and having to still come out with feminity.</p>  

<b>Initial Stages Of Training</b>
<p>I started the class by being punctual and making sure i finishrd with my assignments.
    The days went by as i struggled to <u>code various websites</u> . At first i thought 
    it wasnt going to make sense but with perseverance and determination , i managed to push through.</p></body>

 <b> Experiences and Lessons Learnt </b>
  As i earlier said , the journey wasn't easy at all 
  At times , i felt like not attending classes and going on with the desicion of ending my cohort.
  But the Lord i serve will not ever give up on me.  
</p>

<p><b>Possibilities Ahead </b>
    As the last  days approach , i know i am yet to face more challenges and come
    out with flying colours.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Beautiful ending</b> 
   The most beautiful part of everything is tha  <i>it  will come out with as certificate</i> and that 
   people will give me opportunities , i have been waiting for.
